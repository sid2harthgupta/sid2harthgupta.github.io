                        <p>
                        The fare structure in Brisbane is dependent on the locations of the origin and destination stops of a journey and is independent of the route chosen. Passengers often have the option of choosing between services/routes based on travel time, reliability and comfort of travel.</br>
                        Presently, the information regarding these decisions is accrued gradually with travel experience. And once travel decisions begin to concur with service behavior during the period of judgement, it is an imposing task for travelers to re-evaluate services to update their decision.</br>
                        The decision outcome evidently depends on the purpose of trip being undertaken and the accessibility of the stop a service is available at, but misjudgments regarding service characteristics can lead to a poorer travel experience for passengers and lesser efficiency for transit services.</br></br>
                        With the availability of Smart Card data, it is possible to keep travelers up to date with the performance of transit services. Two of the basic performance metrics that can be made available to travelers include the arrival time reliability and expected occupancy of any transit service.</br>
                        One of the objectives of this survey is to model the way availability of service performance information impacts choices made by the travelers.</br></br>
                        
                        The ability to identify regions/corridors of travel opens up the possibility of producing a wide range of route choice for travelers. The determination of elasticities with regards to access and egress can help in providing more relevant results to travelers.</br>
                        
                        Once we know the fare elasticities and cross elasticities for the attributes mentioned in objective 2, we can not only provide better route choices to travelers but also consider improving and altering service operations to serve travelers better.</br></br>

                        <h1>Information systems for transit network planning and utilization</h1>
                        <p>To build a set of tools that enables the stakeholders in a public transit system to organize and utilize the system in a more efficient and sustainable way.</br>
                        The tools shall derive their learning from observed traveler behavior, as captured by (but not limited to) various systems including Automated Fare Collection (AFC) systems and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems, and stated traveler preferences, in the form of surveys.</br>
                        The goal of attaining better organization and utilization shall be met primarily through the following objectives:</br>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Providing travelers information regarding their likely overall travel experience rather than restricting it to the availability of means to travel. This shall include the provision of occupancy and arrival time reliability information.</li>
                        <li>Monitoring the amount of transportation-work produced by transit vehicles and analyzing how this can be improved through changes in service schedules or alterations in the stopping pattern.</li>
                        <li>Using observed traveler behavior from the AFC system of Brisbane to determine the demand for travel between different ‘regions’, rather than different stops, to enable services plying between common regions to tackle the total demand in the most concerted way.</li>
                        <li>Building a simulation tool that schedules transit vehicles on existing routes to best fulfill the region-wise demands while maximizing work utilization including considering the utilization lost in transfer to and from depots. The simulation shall consider the elasticity for parameters including occupancy, travel time, access, and egress etc. as indicated by the survey. The results from this simulation shall be funneled into the operator information system.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Other than these, we shall explore other approaches towards achieving our goal. These include microscopic pricing strategies and promoting regularity over stochasticity in the network among others.</br>
                        Throughout the development, the scalability and portability of the tools shall assume importance so that they can be implemented in different data situations. A first step in this shall be hosting the beta development on a web portal.</br>
