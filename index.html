                        <h1>Fractional factorial design of survey produced using a mix and match variant of the rotation method. Dissemination through Survey Monkey/UQ mailing lists</h1>
                        <p>
                        The fare structure in Brisbane is dependent on the locations of the origin and destination stops of a journey and is independent of the route chosen. Passengers often have the option of choosing between services/routes based on travel time, reliability and comfort of travel.</br>
                        Presently, the information regarding these decisions is accrued gradually with travel experience. And once travel decisions begin to concur with service behavior during the period of judgement, it is an imposing task for travelers to re-evaluate services to update their decision.</br>
                        The decision outcome evidently depends on the purpose of trip being undertaken and the accessibility of the stop a service is available at, but misjudgments regarding service characteristics can lead to a poorer travel experience for passengers and lesser efficiency for transit services.</br></br>
                        With the availability of Smart Card data, it is possible to keep travelers up to date with the performance of transit services. Two of the basic performance metrics that can be made available to travelers include the arrival time reliability and expected occupancy of any transit service.</br>
                        One of the objectives of this survey is to model the way availability of service performance information impacts choices made by the travelers.</br></br>
                        
                        The ability to identify regions/corridors of travel opens up the possibility of producing a wide range of route choice for travelers. The determination of elasticities with regards to access and egress can help in providing more relevant results to travelers.</br>
                        
                        Once we know the fare elasticities and cross elasticities for the attributes mentioned in objective 2, we can not only provide better route choices to travelers but also consider improving and altering service operations to serve travelers better.</br></br>

                        <p>The quality of incoming GPS data is decisive for the accuracy and reliability of the information provided by an AVL system. Some of the factors are systemic, occurring prior to reception at data servers. Others can be related to the methodology employed for computation. The paper explores some of these parameters and concentrates both on data extraction for live traffic maps as well as forecasting of traffic conditions using Kalman filters.</p>

                        <h1>Information systems for transit network planning and utilization</h1>
                        <p>To build a set of tools that enables the stakeholders in a public transit system to organize and utilize the system in a more efficient and sustainable way.</br>
                        The tools shall derive their learning from observed traveler behavior, as captured by (but not limited to) various systems including Automated Fare Collection (AFC) systems, Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems, Landuse information and stated traveler preferences.</br>
                        The goal of attaining better organization and utilization shall be met primarily through the following objectives:</br>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Providing travelers information regarding their likely overall travel experience rather than restricting it to the availability of means to travel. This shall include the provision of occupancy and arrival time reliability information.</li>
                        <li>Analysis of individual level travel itineraries to determine purpose of travel and popular destinations</li>
                        <li>Monitoring the amount of transportation-work produced by transit vehicles and analyzing how this can be improved through changes in service schedules or alterations in the stopping pattern.</li>
                        <li>Using observed traveler behavior from the AFC system of Brisbane to determine the demand for travel between different ‘regions’, rather than different stops, to enable services plying between common regions to tackle the total demand in the most concerted way.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Other than these, we shall explore other approaches towards achieving our goal. These include microscopic pricing strategies and promoting regularity over stochasticity in the network among others.</br>
                        <font color="red">6 month update</font></br>
                        A traveler information system predicting bus reliability and occupancy has been developed and being improved.</br>
                        Determination of activity purpose using passive transit information is being undertaken. Results from this analysis shall soon be extended to other sources of data.</br>
                        The analysis scripts are available and shall hopefully serve as seed for future urban anlysis.</br>
